# Session 5: Open Source Geospatial Tools for Conservation under Climate Change - a Koala Case Study
# Making Beautiful Maps with QGIS!

Welcome to the QGIS Cartography componment of this course. This session was created to show the possibilities available to craft maps in QGIS from geotiffs created in R. For more processing options in QGIS with R, check out the [QGIS plugin for Processing R Provider](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/processing_r/#plugin-details) - A Processing provider for connecting to the R statistics framework.

In this course, we will endeavour to learn about:
- Establishing efficient workflows for repetitive work using: styles, layouts, templates
- Cartographic hints and tips

Producing a cartographic product is important to effectively display the results of your investigation. Itâ€™s incredible that ALL of that work can be simply represented, but then, that shows a element of success in your work.

A cartographic product does not just have to be a map with traditional marginalia around it #retro! However it is required sometimes for legislative reasons and reporting to clients when you are in a consulting position. What we are going to produce here is a cartographic product that will display the information you are discussing in a visual sense.

The whole course can be found at the [ICCB - Open Geospatial Tools](https://geospatial-community.github.io/ICCB_geospatial_tools_conservation/) run by Geospatial Share Community of Practice.
