<p>Welcome to the QGIS Cartography ICCB course!</p>
<p>Use the sidebar to navigate through the modules.</p>
<p>In this course, we will endeavour to learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrating R and QGIS</li>
<li>Establishing efficient workflows for repetitive work using: styles, layouts, templates</li>
<li>Cartographic hints and tips</li>
</ul>
<p>Producing a cartographic product is important to effectively display the results of your investigation. Itâ€™s incredible that ALL of that work can be simply represented, but then, that shows a element of success in your work.</p>
<p>A cartographic product does not just have to be a map with traditional marginalia around it, in fact, that can be incredibly boring. However it is required sometimes for legislative reasons and reporting to clients when you are in a consulting position. What we are going to produce here is a cartographic product that will display the information you are talking about in a visual sense.</p>
