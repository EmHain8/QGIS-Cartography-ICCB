# Introduction


Welcome to the QGIS Cartography ICCB course!

Use the sidebar to navigate through the modules.

In this course, we will endeavour to learn about:
- Integrating R and QGIS
- Establishing efficient workflows for repetitive work using: styles, layouts, templates
- Cartographic hints and tips

Producing a cartographic product is important to effectively display the results of your investigation. Itâ€™s incredible that ALL of that work can be simply represented, but then, that shows a element of success in your work.

A cartographic product does not just have to be a map with traditional marginalia around it, in fact, that can be incredibly boring. However it is required sometimes for legislative reasons and reporting to clients when you are in a consulting position. What we are going to produce here is a cartographic product that will display the information you are talking about in a visual sense.
