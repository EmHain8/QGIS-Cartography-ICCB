**Title**: Koala Conservation under Climate Change

**Description text**
Koalas (*Phascolarctos cinereus*) in South East Queensland (SEQ) inhabit fragmented eucalypt woodlands and rely heavily on Eucalyptus species for food and shelter. The population is already under pressure from habitat loss, disease (notably chlamydia), and vehicle collisions. Climate change poses additional threats through increased frequency of heatwaves, droughts, and bushfires, which reduce food quality, water availability, and suitable habitat. This workshop set out to apply open source geospatial tools to better understanding how future climate may impact these populations, and how resources can be best directed towards conserving this iconic species.

### Maps
1.Area of Interest (AOI) - South East Queensland (SEQ)

2. Overall Change (climate downscaled model) - Session 2 output

    - Intention: Show the difference between the base line (historical) average temperature over Queensland and the temperature at the end of the century under the SSP370 (high) scenario
    - Data: tasChange_GFDL-ESM4_r1i1p1f1_CCAM10_AUS-10i_1981-2010-vs-2071-2100 
    - Symbols: 1 = less change, 4 = greater change degrees C

3. Climatic suitability for koalas - Session 3 output

    - Data: predictions_current
    - Symbol: 0 being completely unsuitable and 1 being excellent climatic suitability
      
4. Projected suitability change (SSP370), current to 2090 - Session 3 output 

   - Intention: change between the current and future suitability - shows koalaâ€™s response to the projected climate changes. SSP370 minus current
   - Data: SSP370: future370-current.tif
   - Symbol: rise in temperature decrease > increase (-1, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 1)

5. Priority areas for conservation - Session 4 output

      - Intention: Show areas throughout SEQ that are priority areas for conservation
      - Data: scenario _4.tif
      - Symbol: 1 = Priority area
